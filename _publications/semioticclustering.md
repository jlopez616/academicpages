Designing for organizational change has become an increasingly important goal in the learning sciences. To do so, we must develop processes that highlight organizational infrastructures that inform both research and design. In this paper, we share our experience conducting semiotic cluster analysis to map organizational infrastructures within a research practice partnership. We describe how semiotic analysis attuned us to relationships that speak to organizational factors influencing the objectives of our RPP. Then, we share our process for generating design conjectures that attend to the organizational infrastructure identified through semiotic analysis. Our work provides an example of tracing surface level observations to core organizational needs.
